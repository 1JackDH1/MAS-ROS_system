Current project containing Jason agents and Java environment code.

Project Notes for most recent version:
- JDK 15.0

- javax.json dependency issue related to incompatibility with opening .asl files for accessing Jason agents (doesn't hinder program execution in jEdit, however causes program failure when using the Jason plugin within Eclipse)
